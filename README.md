[Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev/angular)

## Architectural Decisions

### Front End 
A single product module having multiple components to serve a tab-based interaction. Angular Material implementation to provide consistent UI.

FE features included
1. Modularity
2. Animations
3. Separate Directives/Custom Validators
4. Material Design Pattern
5. Standard Icons
6. Optimized Search

### Back End
A single product module handling the Controllers,Service and Schemas with secure connection.

BE features include
1. Modularity
2. Dependency Injection
3. Class-Validators to pre-validate API communication
4. Exception Handling
5. Shared Code
6. API hit limit based on IPs

## Build and Serve

Run `npm run serve-app` to build and run the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This will open the default browser page after the Node server has started.

## Scope of Improvement

1. Meta-search on Front-end and backend
2. Runtime Configurable Databases
3. Indexing when app scales
4. Authentication and Authorization if scope is restricted
